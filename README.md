# Machine Learning Pracs
## Machine Learning pracs to... study?

### Practical shit
1. Practical 1 - code missing?
2. Practical 2 - Linear regression - just run the cells
3. Practical 3 - Logistic regression - social network dataset
4. Practical 4 
    1. Ensemble Learner - diabetes dataset
    2. Decision tree - Social network ads
5. Practical 5 - SVM - diabetes dataset
6. Practical 6 - DBSCAN - just run the cells
7. Practical 7 - PCA/SVD - don't run last cell plt.cm.j, rest runs fine

#### few notes for the unexperienced 
- ctrl+enter or shift+enter to run cells in ipynb files
- press 'esc' to enter command mode in jupyter 
    - then press dd to delete cells or other shit idk
- remember, just delete the cell that doesn't work, shit doesn't matter anyway
